The forest was still, holding its breath as if it too sensed the weight of what was to come.

"Are you sure this is the way?" Kalen asked, his voice low.

Elara nodded, eyes fixed ahead. “The map ends here, but the stories say the ruins lie just beyond the silver birch.”

Thunder rumbled in the distance. They didn’t have much time.</div>

        The rain had started sometime before dawn, soaking the cobblestone streets and casting the city in a dull silver glow. Mara stood at the edge of the old bridge, her coat pulled tightly around her, watching the river churn beneath. She hadn't expected to return, not after all these years, but something about the letter had drawn her back like a thread tugging at the seams of her memory.
        <br><br>
        Inside the café, the smell of coffee and old books wrapped around her like a familiar song. She chose a corner seat by the window, the same one she used to sit in every Thursday afternoon. The place hadn't changed much. The same dusty shelves, the same soft hum of conversation, and the same crooked picture hanging above the counter. Time had moved forward, but here it felt paused.

        He entered just as she was finishing her second cup. His hair was streaked with gray now, and his gait carried the weight of years she hadn’t seen. For a moment, he didn’t notice her. Then their eyes met, and the years dissolved between them like sugar in hot tea. Nothing was said. Not yet. But everything was understood.
